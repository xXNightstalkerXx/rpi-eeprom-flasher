# rpi-eeprom-flasher
This Repository has some bash Scripts in it that make it easier to manage the EEPROM flashing process on a Raspberry Pi with the Kali Linux Distro installed.

I'm not an expert Coder so use this Repo on your own Risk and don't blame me if you have to reinstall your Raspberry.
Also flashing the EEPROM on a different Distro than Raspbian bears some risks and might brick your Raspberry Pi!

Feel free to contribute to this Repository and make it better :)
